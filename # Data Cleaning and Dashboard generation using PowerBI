# Data Cleaning and Dashboard generation using PowerBI

  The objective of this project is to demonstrate data cleaning of a table that consists of 10,000 rows using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 22 (MSSQL). The table came from Kaggle and was chosen because of how it mirrors how dirty real-world datasets can be. It consists of intentional missing values, inconsistent data, and errors. Later in the project after the data cleaning, the resulting cleaned table will be used to create a dashboard using PowerBI and draw insights from it.  (Note: The PowerBI dashboard will not be included in this document but will be available from this same folder.
